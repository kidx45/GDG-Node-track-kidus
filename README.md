# GDG Node.js Track – Learning Tasks

This repository is part of the **GDG Node.js Track** and contains hands-on learning tasks focused on building a strong foundation in **Node.js**, **Express**, and **RESTful API development**.

Each task is organized clearly and may be moved into **separate branches** as the learning journey progresses.

---

## Project Structure

- **[`Task 1`](./task1/README.md)** – Basic HTTP server and Student REST API
- **[`Task 2`](./task2/README.md)** – Introduction to the Express framework and REST APIs
- **[`Task 3`](./task3/README.md)** – Input validation and MVC folder structure (Book API)
- **[`Mini Project`](./mini-project/README.md)** – Simple E-Commerce application using MVC, Express, and ES6+ modules

## Notes

Each folder contains its own implementation and demonstrates specific backend concepts, progressively building toward a complete application structure.

Feel free to explore each task to understand the concepts covered.

## How to Run the Servers

You first need to install the necessary dependencies (if any) within the directory of each task using the command:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, you can start the server using the command:

```bash
npm run dev
```
